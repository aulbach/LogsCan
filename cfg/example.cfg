# where to store the position, till where the logfile was scanned at the last time
positionfile  = .logscan-aul-dev-php_error.pos

# the logfile itself
logfile       = /home/prg/apache_php5/logs/vrnet/aul-dev/php_error.log

# the blockdelimiter;
# logscan reads line by line, until this marker is found,
# the read lines are one block and so it can be parsed as one string
blockdelimit  = /^\[\d\d-[A-Z][a-zÃ¤][a-z]-\d{4} \d\d:\d\d:\d\d]\s/

# this option is for usage in crontab, when it doesn't matter, when a rule was found:
# if set to 1, the last line of the logfile is skipped and the new position remains
# at the point after reading the line BEFORE the last line.
# This is, because we cannot be sure, that the last line was written completly and
# don't need to rescan the last line or you will get double errors.
skip_last_line = 0

# a block cannot be longer than this number of lines (to prevent eating up memory)
maxblocklines = 1000

# so many blocks should be read in maximum
# use this option for very, very high log traffic to limit load and overrun!
# set empty or 0 to ignore
maxblocks     =

# by default everything is printed to STDOUT and STDERR
# only if called with option --showconfig
# or when the script dies, this cannot be overridden!
stdout        = >&STDOUT
stderr        = >&STDERR

# some more examples, which make sense
#
# This makes sense if you use crontab to mail the errors.
# In this case you DO NOT NEED to configure the email-addresses for the rules,
# and every error goes to ONE adress:
#
# stdout = >>/dev/null
# stderr = 
#
# You can of course log into different logfiles,
# but also log everything into ONE logfile:
#
# stdout        = >>./logscan.log
# stderr        = >>./logscan.log

# logline uses sprintf to echo a line
# this looks like: [Tue Apr 21 12:57:18 2009 #0] START with configuration 'logscan.config'
logline       = [%s #%%s] %s\n

# this makes also sense:
# logline = %2$s\n

# sendmail config
sendmail      = /usr/sbin/sendmail
sendmail_from = logscanner@devbiz
sendmail_subject = [LOGSCAN] %s in %s

# this number of rules can be found,
# after this the script ends itself as when the eof has reached
